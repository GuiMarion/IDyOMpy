This project propose a Python implementation for the IDyOM model made by `Marcus Pearce <https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/idyom-project>`_
. 

This code implements an automatic documentation as well as unit tests for every functions. The code is currently under developpement, however, this website will be updated regularly.


Get Started
***********

You can get the project from GitHub:
====================================

	git clone https://github.com/GuiMarion/IDyOM.git

Install dependencies:
=====================

  pip install -r requirements.txt

And then use it!
================

Usage: usage App.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a TESTS, --test=TESTS
                        1 if you want to launch unittests
  -t TRAIN_FOLDER, --train=TRAIN_FOLDER
                        Train the model with the passed folder
  -s TRIAL_FOLDER, --surprise=TRIAL_FOLDER
                        Compute surprise over the passed folder. We use -t
                        argument to train, if none are privided, we use the
                        passed folder to cross-train.
  -n TRIAL_FOLDER_SILENT, --silentNotes=TRIAL_FOLDER_SILENT
                        Compute silent notes probabilities over the passed
                        folder. We use -t argument to train, if none are
                        provided, we use the passed folder to cross-train.
  -d THRESHOLD_MISSING_NOTES, --threshold_missing_notes=THRESHOLD_MISSING_NOTES
                        Define the threshold for choosing the missing notes
                        (0.3 by default)
  -z ZERO_PADDING, --zero_padding=ZERO_PADDING
                        Specify if you want to use zero padding in the
                        surprise output, enable time representation (default
                        0)
  -p LISP, --lisp=LISP  plot comparison with the lisp version
  -b SHORT_TERM_ONLY, --short_term=SHORT_TERM_ONLY
                        Only use short term model (default 0)
  -c CROSS_EVAL, --cross_eval=CROSS_EVAL
                        Compute likelihoods by pieces over the passed dataset
                        using k-fold cross-eval.
  -l LONG_TERM_ONLY, --long_term=LONG_TERM_ONLY
                        Only use long term model (default 0)
  -k K_FOLD, --k_fold=K_FOLD
                        Specify the k-fold for all cross-eval, you can use -1
                        for leave-one-out (default 5).
  -q QUANTIZATION, --quantization=QUANTIZATION
                        Rythmic quantization to use (default 24).
  -v VIEWPOINTS, --viewPoints=VIEWPOINTS
                        Viewpoints to use (pitch, length or both), default
                        both
  -m MAX_ORDER, --max_order=MAX_ORDER
                        Maximal order to use (default 20).
