             ===============================================
             Licence Information for CCARH MuseData Editions
             ===============================================

All musical data supplied by the Center for Computer Assisted Research in
the Humanities (CCARH) is protected by United States Copyright Law and by
associated international treaties.  Use of this data is regulated by a
licensing agreement printed on the original distribution package.  Opening
the distribution package indicated your acceptance of these terms and
conditions.  This license agreement places notable restrictions and
obligations on the licensee.

For convenience, the terms and conditions of the licensing agreement are
restated below:

(1)  MuseData is a registered trademark of the Center for Computer
     Assisted Research in the Humanities (hereafter "CCARH").
     MuseData designates data files produced and distributed by CCARH.

(2) The enclosed MuseData files are licensed (not sold).  CCARH grants
    to you, and you accept, a nonexclusive license to use the enclosed
    data, only as authorized in this Agreement.

(3) In some cases, MuseData files are created under special agreements
    with other copyright holders.  Distribution of the corresponding
    MuseData files occurs under the explicit understanding that MuseData
    users will also abide by these agreements.  Specifically, this
    license does not authorize the use of the enclosed MuseData files
    in the production of derivative editions intended for commercial
    distribution, nor for public performance (including broadcast),
    nor for sound recording.  Users contemplating such uses are
    advised to contact CCARH in order to obtain precise information
    on the copyright status of the enclosed material.

(4) The enclosed MuseData files are for personal use (single-user)*
    only.  This software may be used "just like a book".  The
    software may be transferred from one computer location to another,
    and may be used by any number of people provided there is NO
    POSSIBILITY of it being used by more than one person or in more
    than one location concurrently.  The individual opening this
    package is responsible for ensuring that other users of data
    originating from this specific copy are INFORMED of the terms
    and conditions of this licensing agreement.

(5) MuseData files are made available only for the purpose of academic
    research;  MuseData files may be used in the course of teaching,
    but under no circumstance is the data to be embedded or included
    in teaching materials for commercial or non-commercial distribution.
    This condition includes subsets of the MuseData files that would
    exceed the "fair use" interpretation of U.S. copyright law.

(6) CCARH must be acknowledged as the source of data in any publications,
    computer programs or other products resulting from or involving the
    use of this data.

(7) Copyright is claimed by CCARH on its data files and compilations.
    This copyright must be reproduced or acknowledged in any quotations
    of its data appearing in any medium of audible, visual, or tactile
    display.

(8) Users are authorized to make archival or "back-up" copies of
    MuseData files for the sole purpose of protecting the data from
    inadvertent loss.

(9) In the creation of its encoded materials, CCARH applies rigorous
    standards of data verification.  It cannot, however, warrant that
    the data is free of encoding errors or other defects.  CCARH may
    not be held accountable for any losses suffered by users of its
    data.  CCARH's cumulative liability for any loss or damages
    resulting from any claims, demands, or actions arising out of
    or relating to this Agreement shall not exceed the license fee
    paid for use of the data.

This agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the
laws of the State of California.

* Users interested in multi-user or site licenses should contact CCARH.
